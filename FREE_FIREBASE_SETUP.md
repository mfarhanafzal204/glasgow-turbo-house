# 🆓 FREE Firebase Setup - No Billing Required

## 🚨 **IMPORTANT: Firebase Storage IS FREE**

Firebase is asking for billing info as a verification, but you can use it completely free within these limits:

### **Firebase Free Tier Limits (Spark Plan):**
- **Storage:** 1 GB free
- **Downloads:** 10 GB/month free
- **Uploads:** 20,000/day free
- **Firestore:** 50,000 reads/day free
- **Authentication:** Unlimited free

**These limits are MORE than enough for your turbo store!**

2. Click **"Add payment method"**
3. Add your card details
4. **Important:** Stay on **"Spark Plan (Free)"**

3. This ensures you're never charged
